.SH Command \f[I]\[aq]cpu-hotplug\[aq]\f[R]
.SS General options
.TP
\f[B]-h\f[R]
Show a short help message and exit.
.TP
\f[B]-q\f[R]
Be quiet.
.TP
\f[B]-d\f[R]
Print debugging information.
.TP
\f[B]--version\f[R]
Print version and exit.
.TP
\f[B]-H\f[R] \f[I]HOSTNAME\f[R], \f[B]--host\f[R] \f[I]HOSTNAME\f[R]
Name of the host to run the command on.
.TP
\f[B]-U\f[R] \f[I]USERNAME\f[R], \f[B]--username\f[R] \f[I]USERNAME\f[R]
Name of the user to use for logging into the remote host over SSH.
The default user name is \[aq]root\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]-K\f[R] \f[I]PRIVKEY\f[R], \f[B]--priv-key\f[R] \f[I]PRIVKEY\f[R]
Path to the private SSH key that should be used for logging into the
remote host.
By default the key is automatically found from standard paths like
\[aq]$HOME/.ssh\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]-T\f[R] \f[I]TIMEOUT\f[R], \f[B]--timeout\f[R] \f[I]TIMEOUT\f[R]
SSH connection timeout in seconds, default is 8.
.TP
\f[B]-D\f[R] \f[I]DATASET\f[R], \f[B]--dataset\f[R] \f[I]DATASET\f[R]
This option is for debugging and testing purposes only, it defines the
dataset that will be used to emulate a host for running the command on.
This option is typically used when running \[aq]pepc\[aq] from the
source code directory, which includes datasets for many different
systems.
.RS
.PP
The argument can be the dataset path, \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all
available dataset or name in which case the following locations will be
searched for.
.IP "1." 3
\[aq]./tests/data\[aq], in the directory of the running program
.IP "2." 3
\[aq]$PEPC_DATA_PATH/tests/data\[aq]
.IP "3." 3
\[aq]$HOME/.local/share/pepc/tests/data\[aq]
.IP "4." 3
\[aq]/usr/local/share/pepc/tests/data\[aq]
.IP "5." 3

.RE
.TP
\f[B]--force-color\f[R]
Force coloring of the text output.
.SS Subcommand \f[I]\[aq]info\[aq]\f[R]
.PP
List all online and offline CPUs.
.SS Subcommand \f[I]\[aq]online\[aq]\f[R]
.PP
Bring CPUs online.
.TP
\f[B]--cpus\f[R] \f[I]CPUS\f[R]
List of CPUs to online.
The list can include individual CPU numbers and CPU number ranges.
For example,\[aq]1-4,7,8,10-12\[aq] would mean CPUs 1 to 4, CPUs 7, 8,
and 10 to 12.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all CPUs.
.SS Subcommand \f[I]\[aq]offline\[aq]\f[R]
.PP
Bring CPUs offline.
.TP
\f[B]--cpus\f[R] \f[I]CPUS\f[R]
List of CPUs to offline.
The list can include individual CPU numbers and CPU number ranges.
For example,\[aq]1-4,7,8,10-12\[aq] would mean CPUs 1 to 4, CPUs 7, 8,
and 10 to 12.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all CPUs.
.TP
\f[B]--cores\f[R] \f[I]CORES\f[R]
List of cores to offline.
The list can include individual core numbers and core number ranges.
For example, \[aq]1-4,7,8,10-12\[aq] would mean cores 1 to 4, cores 7,
8, and 10 to 12.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all cores.
This option has to be accompanied by \[aq]--package\[aq] option, because
core numbers are per-package.
.TP
\f[B]--packages\f[R] \f[I]PACKAGES\f[R]
List of packages to offline.
The list can include individual package numbers and package number
ranges.
For example, \[aq]0,2-4\[aq] would mean package 0 and packages 2 to 4.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all packages.
.TP
\f[B]--core-siblings\f[R] \f[I]CORE_SIBLINGS\f[R]
List of core sibling indices to offline.
The list can include individual core sibling indices or index ranges.
For example, core x includes CPUs 3 and 4, \[aq]0\[aq] would mean CPU 3
and \[aq]1\[aq] would mean CPU 4.
This option can only be used to reference online CPUs, because Linux
does not provide topology information for offline CPUs.
In the previous example if CPU 3 was offline, then \[aq]0\[aq] would
mean CPU 4.
