\f[B]\-D\f[R] \f[I]DATASET\f[R], \f[B]\-\-dataset\f[R] \f[I]DATASET\f[R]
This option is for debugging and testing purposes only, it defines the
dataset that will be used to emulate a host for running the command on.
This option is typically used when running \[aq]pepc\[aq] from the
source code directory, which includes datasets for many different
systems.
.RS
.PP
The argument can be the dataset path, \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all
available dataset or name in which case the following locations will be
searched for.
.IP "1." 3
\[aq]./tests/data\[aq], in the directory of the running program
.IP "2." 3
\[aq]$PEPC_DATA_PATH/tests/data\[aq]
.IP "3." 3
\[aq]$HOME/.local/share/pepc/tests/data\[aq]
.IP "4." 3
\[aq]/usr/local/share/pepc/tests/data\[aq]
.IP "5." 3
\[aq]/usr/share/pepc/tests/data\[aq]
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-\-force\-color\f[R]
Force coloring of the text output.
.SS Subcommand \f[I]\[aq]info\[aq]\f[R]
Print CPU topology information.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R], Linux kernel provides topology information only for
online CPUs, but not for offline CPUs.
Therefore, unknown topology numbers (e.g., package number) for offline
CPUs are substituted with \[dq]?\[dq].
.TP
\f[B]\-\-cpus\f[R] \f[I]CPUS\f[R]
List of CPUs to print topology information for.
The list can include individual CPU numbers and CPU number ranges.
For example,\[aq]1\-4,7,8,10\-12\[aq] would mean CPUs 1 to 4, CPUs 7, 8,
and 10 to 12.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all CPUs.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-cores\f[R] \f[I]CORES\f[R]
List of cores to print topology information for.
The list can include individual core numbers and core number ranges.
For example, \[aq]1\-4,7,8,10\-12\[aq] would mean cores 1 to 4, cores 7,
8, and 10 to 12.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all cores.
This option has to be accompanied by the \[aq]\-\-package\[aq] option,
because core numbers are per\-package.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-modules\f[R] \f[I]MODULES\f[R]
List of dies to print topology information for.
The list can include individual module numbers and module number ranges.
For example, \[aq]0,2\-5\[aq] would mean module 0 and modules 2, 3, 4,
and 5.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all modules.
Note, unlike core and die numbers, module numbers are absolute.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-dies\f[R] \f[I]DIES\f[R]
List of dies to print topology information for.
The list can include individual die numbers and die number ranges.
For example, \[aq]0\-3,5\[aq] would mean dies 0 to 3, and die 5.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all dies.
On some systems, die numbers are globally unique, while on other systems
they are relative to the package.
In the latter case, this option has to be accompanied by the
\[aq]\-\-package\[aq] option.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-packages\f[R] \f[I]PACKAGES\f[R]
List of packages to print topology information for.
The list can include individual package numbers and package number
ranges.
For example, \[aq]0,2\-4\[aq] would mean package 0 and packages 2 to 4.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all packages.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-core\-siblings\f[R] \f[I]CORE_SIBLINGS\f[R]
Core siblings are CPUs sharing the same core.
The list can include individual core sibling indices or index ranges.
For example, if a core includes CPUs 3 and 4, index \[aq]0\[aq] would
mean CPU 3 and index \[aq]1\[aq] would mean CPU 4.
This option can only be used to reference online CPUs, because Linux
does not provide topology information for offline CPUs.
In the example with CPUs 3 and 4, if CPU 3 was offline, then index
\[aq]0\[aq] would mean CPU 4.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-module\-siblings\f[R] \f[I]MODULE_SIBLINGS\f[R]
Module siblings are CPUs sharing the same module.
The list can include individual module sibling indices or index ranges.
For example, if a module includes CPUs 3, 4, 5, and 6, index \[aq]0\[aq]
would mean CPU 3, index \[aq]1\[aq] would mean CPU 4, and idex
\[aq]3\[aq] would mean CPU 5.
This option can only be used to reference online CPUs, because Linux
does not provide topology information for offline CPUs.
In the example with CPUs 3, 4, 5 and 6, if CPU 4 was offline, then index
\[aq]1\[aq] would mean CPU 5.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-order\f[R] \f[I]ORDER\f[R]
By default, the topology table is printed in CPU number order.
Use this option to print it in a different order (e.g., core or package
number order).
Here are the supported order names: cpu, core, module, die, node,
package.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-online\-only\f[R]
Include only online CPUs.
By default offline and online CPUs are included.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-columns\f[R] \f[I]COLUMNS\f[R]
Comma\-separated list of the topology columns to print.
Available columns are: CPU, core, module, die, node, package, hybrid.
Example: \-\-columns Package,Core,CPU.
By default, all columns that are meaningful for the platform are
printed.
If the platform does not have modules or dies, the corresponding columns
won\[aq]t be printed.
The \[dq]hybrid\[dq] column is not printed for non\-hybrid
