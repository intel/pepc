# Map VFM (Vendor, Family, Model) to TPMI spec files sub-directory name.
#
# Note: TPMI API is architectural, which means that the same interface is expected to be
# supported across different CPU models and generations. However, newer platforms may add new
# registers and obsolete older ones (making them no-op). This file provides a mechanism for making
# TPMI spec files per-platform, when needed.
#
# Refer to 'CPUModels.py' for details on VFM encoding.
#
# VFM encoding: (vendor << 16) | (family << 8) | model
# Intel vendor code = 0, so VFM = (family << 8) | model
#
# Examples:
#   Family 6, Model 0xAD -> (6 << 8) | 0xAD = 0x600 | 0xAD = 0x6AD
#   Family 19, Model 0x1 -> (19 << 8) | 0x1 = 0x1300 | 0x1 = 0x1301
#
