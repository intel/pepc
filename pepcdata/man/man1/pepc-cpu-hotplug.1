.SH Command \f[I]\[aq]cpu\-hotplug\[aq]\f[R]
.SS General options
.TP
\f[B]\-h\f[R]
Show a short help message and exit.
.TP
\f[B]\-q\f[R]
Be quiet (print only important messages like warnings).
.TP
\f[B]\-d\f[R]
Print debugging information.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-debug\-modules\f[R] \f[I]MODNAME[,MODNAME1,...]\f[R]
While the \[aq]\-d\[aq] option enables all debug messages, this option
limits them to the specified modules.
For example, \[aq]\-d \-\-debug\-modules MSR\[aq] will only show debug
messages from the \[aq]MSR\[aq] module.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-version\f[R]
Print the version number and exit.
.TP
\f[B]\-H\f[R] \f[I]HOSTNAME\f[R], \f[B]\-\-host\f[R] \f[I]HOSTNAME\f[R]
Host name or IP address of the target system.
The pepc command will be executed on this system using SSH, instead of
running it locally.
If not specified, the command will be run locally.
.TP
\f[B]\-U\f[R] \f[I]USERNAME\f[R], \f[B]\-\-username\f[R] \f[I]USERNAME\f[R]
Name of the user to use for logging into the remote host over SSH.
The default user name is \[aq]root\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]\-K\f[R] \f[I]PRIVKEY\f[R], \f[B]\-\-priv\-key\f[R] \f[I]PRIVKEY\f[R]
Path to the private SSH key for logging into the remote host.
Defaults to keys in standard paths like \[aq]$HOME/.ssh\[aq].

\f[B]\-T\f[R] \f[I]TIMEOUT\f[R], \f[B]\-\-timeout\f[R] \f[I]TIMEOUT\f[R]
Timeout for establishing an SSH connection in seconds.
Defaults to 8.
.TP
\f[B]\-D\f[R] \f[I]DATASET\f[R], \f[B]\-\-dataset\f[R] \f[I]DATASET\f[R]
This option is for debugging and testing.
It specifies the dataset to use for emulating the host for running the
command on.
The datasets are available in \[aq]pepc\[aq] source code repository.
.RS
.PP
The argument can be a dataset path or name.
If specified by name, the following locations are searched for the
dataset.
.IP "1." 3
\[aq]./tests/emul\-data\[aq] in the program\[aq]s directory
.IP "2." 3
\[aq]$PEPC_DATA_PATH/tests/emul\-data\[aq]
.IP "3." 3
\[aq]$HOME/.local/share/pepc/tests/emul\-data\[aq]
.IP "4." 3
\[aq]$VIRTUAL_ENV/share/tests/emul\-data\[aq]
.IP "5." 3
\[aq]/usr/local/share/pepc/tests/emul\-data\[aq]
.IP "6." 3
\[aq]/usr/share/pepc/tests/emul\-data\[aq]
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-\-force\-color\f[R]
Force colorized output even if the output stream is not a terminal (adds
ANSI escape codes).
.TP
\f[B]\-\-print\-man\-path\f[R]
Print path to pepc manual pages directory and exit.
This path can be added to the \[aq]MANPATH\[aq] environment variable to
make the manual pages available to the \[aq]man\[aq] tool.
.SS Subcommand \f[I]\[aq]info\[aq]\f[R]
Display the list of online and offline CPUs.
.SS Subcommand \f[I]\[aq]online\[aq]\f[R]
Bring specified CPUs online.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-cpus\f[R] \f[I]CPUS\f[R]
The list can include individual CPU numbers and CPU number ranges.
For example, \[aq]1\-4,7,8,10\-12\[aq] would mean CPUs 1 to 4, CPUs 7,
8, and 10 to 12.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all CPUs.
.SS Subcommand \f[I]\[aq]offline\[aq]\f[R]
Bring specified CPUs offline.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-cpus\f[R] \f[I]CPUS\f[R]
The list can include individual CPU numbers and CPU number ranges.
For example, \[aq]1\-4,7,8,10\-12\[aq] would mean CPUs 1 to 4, CPUs 7,
8, and 10 to 12.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all CPUs.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-cores\f[R] \f[I]CORES\f[R]
The list can include individual core numbers and core number ranges.
For example, \[aq]1\-4,7,9\-11\[aq] would mean cores 1 to 4, cores 7, 9,
10, and 11.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all cores.
This option has to be used with the \[aq]\-\-packages\[aq] option,
because core numbers are relative to the package.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-modules\f[R] \f[I]MODULES\f[R]
The list can include individual module numbers and module number ranges.
For example, \[aq]0,2\-5\[aq] would mean module 0 and modules 2, 3, 4,
and 5.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all modules.
Note, unlike core and die numbers, module numbers are absolute.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-dies\f[R] \f[I]DIES\f[R]
The list can include individual die numbers and die number ranges.
For example, \[aq]0\-3,5\[aq] would mean dies 0 to 3, and die 5.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all dies.
On some systems, die numbers are globally unique, while on other systems
they are relative to the package.
In the latter case, this option has to be used with the
\[aq]\-\-packages\[aq] option.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-packages\f[R] \f[I]PACKAGES\f[R]
The list can include individual package numbers and package number
ranges.
For example, \[aq]0,2\-4\[aq] would mean package 0 and packages 2, 3,
and 4.
Use the special keyword \[aq]all\[aq] to specify all packages.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-core\-siblings\f[R] \f[I]CORE_SIBLINGS\f[R]
Core siblings are CPUs sharing the same core.
The list can include individual core sibling indices or index ranges.
For example, if a core includes CPUs 2 and 3, index 0 would mean CPU 2
and index 1 would mean CPU 3.
This option can only be used to reference online CPUs, because Linux
does not provide topology information for offline CPUs.
In the example with CPUs 2 and 3, if CPU 2 was offline, then index 0
would mean CPU 3.
On Intel processors with hyper\-threading, this is typically used to
offline hyperthreads.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-module\-siblings\f[R] \f[I]MODULE_SIBLINGS\f[R]
Module siblings are CPUs sharing the same module.
The list can include individual module sibling indices or index ranges.
For example, if a module includes CPUs 4, 5, 6, and 7, index 0 would
mean CPU 4, index 1 would mean CPU 5, index 2 would mean CPU 6, and
index 3 would mean CPU 7.
This option can only be used to reference online CPUs, because Linux
does not provide topology information for offline CPUs.
In the example with CPUs 4, 5, 6, and 7, if CPU 5 was offline, then
index 1 would mean CPU 6, index 2 would mean CPU 7, and index 3 would be
invalid.
