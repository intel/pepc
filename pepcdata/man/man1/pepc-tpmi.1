.SS Background
TPMI, or Topology Aware Register and PM Capsule Interface, is a
memory\-mapped interface for accessing processor registers related to
power management on Intel CPUs.
.PP
These registers are exposed via PCIe VSEC (Vendor\-Specific Extended
Capabilities) and grouped into TPMI features.
For instance, the \[dq]uncore\[dq] feature includes registers for uncore
frequency scaling, the \[dq]rapl\[dq] feature covers Running Average
Power Limit (RAPL) registers, and the \[dq]sst\[dq] feature includes
registers for Intel Speed Select Technology (SST).
.PP
To decode TPMI features, the \[aq]pepc\[aq] tool requires a spec file
describing register names, bits, and offsets in the PCIe memory\-mapped
address space.
Features without a spec file cannot be decoded.
.PP
The \[aq]pepc\[aq] project includes standard spec files searched in the
following locations and order:
.RS
.IP "1." 3
\[aq]./tpmi\[aq], in the directory of the running program
.IP "2." 3
\[aq]$PEPC_DATA_PATH/tpmi\[aq]
.IP "3." 3
\[aq]$HOME/.local/share/pepc/tpmi\[aq]
.IP "4." 3
\[aq]$VIRTUAL_ENV/share/pepc/tpmi\[aq]
.IP "5." 3
\[aq]/usr/local/share/pepc/tpmi\[aq]
.IP "6." 3
\[aq]/usr/share/pepc/tpmi\[aq]
.RE
.PP
Users can also provide custom spec files by placing them in a directory
and setting its path via the \[aq]PEPC_TPMI_DATA_PATH\[aq] environment
variable.
Standard spec files are based on public documentation available at \c
